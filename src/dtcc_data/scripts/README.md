The dtcc-get-data-from-LM.py script is made in order to make LM data downloadable through a script instead of their website

In order to make it work you MUST have access to their API, you can do that through here 
https://geotorget.lantmateriet.se/geodataprodukter/geotorget-nedladdning-api

Once you have access to the API you can use the script by changing the ORDER_ID in line 227 of the script, 
and use the order id of the data you want to download. You can find the order id of the item you want here

If you need to add more data to your account as orders, you can do that from here

You need to enter your email and password in the script.
